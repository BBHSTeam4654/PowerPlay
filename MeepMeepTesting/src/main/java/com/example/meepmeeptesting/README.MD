Create a run configuration for Android Studio.

    - First, click on the drop down menu on the top bar of Android Studio, where it says "TeamCode" with a little Android logo next to it.
    - Click Edit Configurations
    - Click on the "+" symbol in the top left of the window, and when it prompts you, select "Application".
    - Change the name to your liking (ex. meepmeep-run)
    - Where it says "module not specified", click to open the dropdown, then select your JRE.
    - Where it says "cp " click it to open the dropdown, and then select FtcRobotController.MeepMeepTesting.main
    - Where it says "Main Class", click the little "file" icon to the right of the text and then select the name of the main class for your MeepMeepTesting module.
    - From here, in the bottom right of the window, press "Apply" then "Ok".
    - It will now automatically switch to that Run/Debug Configuration profile.
